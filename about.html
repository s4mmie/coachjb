        Born on November 27, 1999, in California, Jordan has been immersed in the world of gaming from the very beginning. Starting with a Game Boy and a Nintendo controller in his hands as early as age 1, gaming quickly became more than just a hobby — it became his lifelong passion.

By the age of 16, Jordan had already made a name for himself in competitive play. He ranked in the Top 10 globally in the Dragon Ball Z Trading Card Game (Panini version) and secured a Top 6 finish at a major regional event. His love for the Dragon Ball universe carried over into video games, where he climbed to Rank 7 in Dragon Ball Xenoverse, showcasing his talent in both card and fighting games.

Jordan then transitioned into competitive Overwatch, reaching the Masters rank and stepping into a coaching role. He’s proud to have coached three players who simultaneously held Top 10 spots in the world, sharpening their skills and guiding them to elite performance levels.

Today, Jordan is making waves in the competitive Marvel Rivals scene. He successfully coached a team to a Top 16 finish in the Marvel Rivals Championship and another to the Top 48, all while helping over 30 players reach the highest competitive rank in the game.

Whether playing or coaching, Jordan brings passion, precision, and a deep understanding of the competitive scene to every match.
